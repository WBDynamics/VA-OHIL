                    <p>Welcome to the 2023 State of Innovation Report, an annual publication from VHA's Office of Healthcare Innovation and Learning! With the theme of "Delivering on the Mission: Fostering Trust and Transforming Care," this year's report focuses on educating and empowering Veterans to engage with the innovative projects and programs that are most relevant to their health care journeys.</p>
                    <p>We encourage eligible Veterans to scan available QR codes, reach out to available email addresses, and ask their VA care teams for more information and guidance on taking advantage of the projects featured in this report. Our providers look forward to hearing from you!</p>
